		<ul>
			<li style="color:#813f2b;"><b>There is no lecture on July 12th.</b> Please use the free time to practice for the end-term exam.
                        <br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">Starting July 4th, all the remaining lectures will be held in LH 313.1. This shift, from LH 308 to LH 313.1, has been made due to lack of air-conditioning in LH 308. Note that you can sit anywhere in LH 313.1 (there's no seating plan for LH 313.1); we will have an alternate method for taking attendance, but the cut-off time will continue to be 18:10 pm.
                        <br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">Today's lab test is cancelled; there's no power supply in the labs. Lab Test 3 to be held in place of the lab session on Wednesday, July 3rd.

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">The lab set-up on Moodle may
require some practice before you get used to it. You are advised to attend the
labs regularly. If you are unaware of how things work in the set-up that we are
using, you may struugle to do well in the lab tests (and we will not be able to
help you at that time). Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to attend the
labs regularly.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">You are advised to verify,
everyday, that your attendance is being marked correctly. Please look at the
<b>attendance record</b> link right above the course calendar. The attendance
for a lecture/lab will (most likely) be updated before the next lecture/lab.
Contact Sanaa Siddiqui (<i>csy227516@iitd.ac.in</i>) <u>by sending her an
email</u> if there has been an error in marking <u>your</u> attendance. Note
that Sanaa has been told to ignore any such "correction" request if it arrives
more than 24 hours after she has marked that attendance. 
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">We are not allocating a TA
to you by default. You are encouraged to ask questions during the lecture, and
we are also available during all the labs to resolve any queries or doubts that
you may have. However, if you need further help, please send me an email
(<i>madhukar@cse.iitd.ac.in</i>) so that I can arrange help.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">The lab attendance can start
anytime (in any order) after 2:10 pm, and if you are not present at your desk
then we will not mark you present even if you turn up later.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">We will be using <a
href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/788532" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>
for the grading related to the course. Please enrol yourself on Gradescope for
this course; the entry code is <b>XG3X3X</b>.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">We will be using Moodle (<a
href="https://moodlenew.iitd.ac.in/"
target="_blank">https://moodle<b>new</b>.iitd.ac.in/)</a> for our labs (and lab
tests).
			<br /><br />
			
			<li style="color:#813f2b;">All announcements will be
made here. Please check this section of this page at least once every day.
			<br />
		</ul>
		</p>
		

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Attendance</i>: 75 percent attendance (both in
lectures as well as in labs) is mandatory. If your attendance is less than 75
percent in either of them, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower
(e.g. A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have
gotten otherwise. The attendance will be taken by taking photographs during the
class (anytime after 6:10 pm and before the end of the class) and on a sheet of
paper during the lab sessions (anytime after 2:10 pm and before the end of the
lab).  One or more photographs can be taken during the lectures, and you need
to present at your allotted seat in <i>every</i> picture for you to marked
present during the class.  <font color="red">Attendance fraud (e.g., sitting in
someone else's seat, leaving after photographs have been taken, changing seats
after the photographs have been taken, etc.) would directly result in an F
grade in the course.</font>
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Lab Tests</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4 lab
tests of 8 marks each, and we will count the best 3 out of 4. The date of all
the four lab tests has been announced. Please look at the course calendar (the
lab tests are highlighted in yellow).
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 16 marks. We will have 3 surprize
quizzes in the class (during the lecture time). These quizzes will be of 8
marks each. If you miss a quiz, there won't be any make-up quiz for you. But we
will be counting the best 2 out of these 3 quizzes.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 25 marks.
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 35 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others
copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/lab. If you are found indulging in such an
activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your submission will not
be counted. In addition, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower (e.g.
A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have gotten
otherwise. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
