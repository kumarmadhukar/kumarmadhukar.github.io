		<ul>
			<li style="color:olive;">We will be having an online
lecture on Sept. 11th (instead of the regular, in-person, lecture). The lecture
timing will be the same. The meeting details have been shared on the Teams
channel for the course. This lecture will be recorded, and we will not have any
quiz in this lecture.
			<br />
			<br />
			
			<li style="color:olive;">I have uploaded the slides and
reference material for all the lectures that have happened till Sept. 11th.
Please see the Lectures section below.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">Here is your <a
href="./slides/assign1.pdf" target="_blank">first assignment</a> for the
course. The due date is Sept. 10th. It is a firm deadline; will not be
extended. You are free to use your penalty-free days if you need to.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">As informed earlier, via
Teams, there won't be any quiz on August 31st.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">No lecture on August 24th.
This will be compensated later with an online lecture.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">We will be using gradescope
for evaluation of assignments, quizzes and exams. Please register yourself for
this course on Gradescope (Entry Code: <b>DJNBV3</b>).
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">We won't have a lecture on
July 27th. This will be compensated with an online lecture, the details of
which will be announced later.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">The best way for you to get in
touch with me would be to send me an email. <b>I will not be replying to
questions or comments on Teams.</b> You are also welcome to meet me in my
office. I would prefer that you set up an appointment over email before coming,
but that is not a necessity.
			<br />
			<br />

			<li style="color:#c6c646;">We will be using the Teams
channel of this course for all the important announcements (some of which may
re-appear here). This section of the page will primarily be used to inform you
of updates made here, e.g. link to reference material or slides, any changes in
the assessment policy, planned rescheduling of a lecture, etc. You should visit
this section of this page at least once every day.
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Suggested Books and Reference Material</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Logic in Computer Science (Michael Huth and Mark Ryan)
			<li> Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Mordechai Ben-Ari)
			<li> <i>(some more may be added as we go along)</i>
		</ul>
		</p>

		
		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments (21 marks)</i>: There will be 3 assignments in
the course, of 7 marks each. The submission deadlines for these assignments
will be <b>firm</b>. However, I will allow each one of you a total of 9 days of
penalty-free delay that you may use anyway you like. Delays beyond 9 days will
cost you 1 mark every three hours.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes (24 marks)</i>: There will be 7 surprize
quizzes in the class (at any time during the class), of 4 marks each. There
cannot be any make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 6.
To make things slighlty better, I will apply an <i>off-day discount</i> before
I count your best 6. This is how the off-day discount would work -- I will
replace your lowest quiz mark, but only amongst those quizzes that you have
attended, with your highest quiz mark.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor exam (20 marks)</i>: If you miss the minor
exam, we will scale your major exam marks to calculate your marks for the
minor. There won't be a re-minor.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major exam (35 marks)</i>: The syllabus for the
major exam will include everything that is covered in the entire course. A
re-major exam will be held, if necessary.
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
		
			<li><i>Attendance policy</i>: We will not be tracking
your attendance in every lecture. However, you must have attended at least 3
quizzes in order to pass/audit-pass.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i> and <i>Audit Pass</i> criteria: You
need a total of at least 30 marks in order to pass the course. For an audit
pass, you must have 45 marks excluding any marks that you get in your
assignments (we will not be evaluating the assignments for students who choose
to audit the course). The attendance policy, mentioned above, will obviously be
applied in addition to this.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others
copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in
such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your
participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be
summarily awarded an F grade.
