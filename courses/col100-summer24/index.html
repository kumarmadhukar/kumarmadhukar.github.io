		<h3 style="color:blue;">Announcements</h3>
		<ul>

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">All announcements will be made here. Please check this section of this page at least once every day.
		</ul>
		</p>
		

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Attendance</i>: 75 percent attendance (both in
lectures as well as in labs) is mandatory. If your attendance is less than 75
percent in either of them, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower
(e.g. A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have
gotten otherwise. 
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Lab Tests</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4 lab tests of 8 marks each, and we will count the best 3 out of 4. The date of all the four lab tests has been announced. Please look at the course calendar (the lab tests are highlighted in yellow).
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 16 marks. We will have 3 surprize quizzes in the class (during the lecture time). These quizzes will be of 8 marks each. If you miss a quiz, there won't be any make-up quiz for you. But we will be counting the best 2 out of these 3 quizzes.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 25 marks.
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 35 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others
copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/lab. If you are found indulging in such an
activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your submission will not
be counted. In addition, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower (e.g.
A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have gotten
otherwise. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
