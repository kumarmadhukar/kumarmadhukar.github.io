		<h3 style="color:blue;">Announcements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="color:#813f2b;">I am likely to make some changes to the seating arrangement till first week of June. Please <b>check your seat before every class</b>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGtKcv_D2nUrFTAmu4TpSVgdXucruiuw-KpMwDXOuoYlQ2w2X9BJCVNOOQ2aCa2TgRFMCADbcWp2Da/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true" target="_blank"><b>Seat allocation for lectures and labs</b></a>
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">Here are the scripts <a href="./files/first-week-python-scripts.zip" download>scripts used in the class during the first week</a>.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">We will be using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/788532" target="_blank">Gradescope</a> for the grading related to the course. Please enrol yourself on Gradescope for this course; the entry code is <b>XG3X3X</b>.
			<br /><br />

			<li style="color:#813f2b;">We will be using Moodle (<a href="https://moodlenew.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank">https://moodle<b>new</b>.iitd.ac.in/)</a> for our labs (and lab tests).
			<br /><br />
			
			<li style="color:#813f2b;">All announcements will be made here. Please check this section of this page at least once every day.
			<br />
		</ul>
		</p>
		

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Attendance</i>: 75 percent attendance (both in
lectures as well as in labs) is mandatory. If your attendance is less than 75
percent in either of them, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower
(e.g. A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have
gotten otherwise. As informed in the class already, starting second week
(everyone will be assumed to be present for all lectures/labs during 20-26
May), the attendance will be taken by taking photographs during the class
(anytime after 6:10 pm and before the end of the class) and on a sheet of paper
during the lab sessions. One or more photographs can be taken during the
lectures, and you need to present at your allotted seat (I will publish the
allotted seats by this May 27th afternoon) in <i>every</i> picture for you to
marked present during the class.  <font color="red">Attendance fraud (e.g.,
sitting in someone else's seat, leaving after photographs have been taken,
changing seats after the photographs have been taken, etc.) would directly
result in an F grade in the course.</font>
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Lab Tests</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4 lab
tests of 8 marks each, and we will count the best 3 out of 4. The date of all
the four lab tests has been announced. Please look at the course calendar (the
lab tests are highlighted in yellow).
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 16 marks. We will have 3 surprize
quizzes in the class (during the lecture time). These quizzes will be of 8
marks each. If you miss a quiz, there won't be any make-up quiz for you. But we
will be counting the best 2 out of these 3 quizzes.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 25 marks.
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 35 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others
copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/lab. If you are found indulging in such an
activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your submission will not
be counted. In addition, your final grade will be one letter-grade lower (e.g.
A will become B, B- will become C-, and so on) than what you would have gotten
otherwise. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
