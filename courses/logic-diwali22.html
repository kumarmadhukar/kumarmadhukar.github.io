		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: There will be 6 assignments in the course, of 7 marks each. Delayed submission will cost you one mark for the first day of delay, and then 2 marks for every subsequent day of delay. Submitting an assignment after all the marks have been lost will <b>not</b> be allowed.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: There will be 8 surprize quizzes in the class (at any time during the class), of 3 marks each. There cannot be any make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 6.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor exam</i>: 15 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major exam</i>: 25 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: In order to pass, you must have attended at least 2 quizzes (one on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 2 assignments (one on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 30 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: You will be awarded an audit pass if you have attended at least 4 quizzes (with at least one quiz on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 3 assignments (with at least one submission on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 45 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
		</ul>
