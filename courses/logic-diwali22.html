		<ul>
			<li style="color:red;">The deadline for Assignment 4
				has been moved <b>further</b> to <b>November
					7th</b>. Late submission penalty, as
				usual, will apply if you submit after 7th Nov.
				Note that the final assignment will uploaded on
				Nov. 5th, and will be due on Nov. 15th.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">We will not have a lecture on
				Nov. 3rd. Instead, we will try to have an extra
				lecture next week, in a slot that is convenient
				to all.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">Slides for the first twenty-two
				lectures have been uploaded (see the bottom of
				this page).
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Note that Quiz 3 and Quiz 4 were
				of 2 and 4 marks respectively. We will change
				the maximum marks of both of these to 3. Your
				marks would be changed as follows. For Quiz 3:
				if you have obtained <i>n</i> marks, you will
				be given 1.5 times <i>n</i>. For Quiz 4: if you
				have obtained <i>n</i> marks, you will be given
				<i>min(3,n)</i>.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Here is the question paper of

					6</a>. The next quiz would not happen
				before Oct. 31st.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">You may have noted that <a
       href="./assign4.pdf" target="_blank">assignment 4</a> is of 14 marks
       (i.e., worth the marks of two assignments). So, we are going to have
       just one more assignment in this course. This (last) assignment will be
       uploaded on (or before) Nov. 5th, and will be due on Nov. 15th.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Here's your <a
       href="./assign4.pdf" target="_blank">fourth assignment</a> for this
			    course. It is due on Nov. 1st.  The late submission
			    rules will apply, as usual, for submissions that
			    are done after Nov. 1st.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">If you believe you are eligible
				for writing a re-minor exam, and if you wish to
				write the exam, you must let me know (if you
				haven't already done so) by 12 noon on Oct.
				18th.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">There was a mistake in one of
				the proofs done in the class on October 13th.
				Here is a <a href="./note.pdf"
				target="_blank">note</a> regarding the same. I
			apologize for this. 
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Deadline for assignment 3
				extended to October 13th. This is a firm
				deadline; no further extensions will be given.
				Late submissions, as per the policy, would of
				course be allowed after 13th.

		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: There will be 6 assignments in the course, of 7 marks each. Delayed submission will cost you one mark for the first day of delay, and then 2 marks for every subsequent day of delay. Submitting an assignment after all the marks have been lost will <b>not</b> be allowed.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: There will be 8 surprize quizzes in the class (at any time during the class), of 3 marks each. There cannot be any make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 6.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor exam</i>: 15 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major exam</i>: 25 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: In order to pass, you must have attended at least 2 quizzes (one on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 2 assignments (one on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 30 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: You will be awarded an audit pass if you have attended at least 4 quizzes (with at least one quiz on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 3 assignments (with at least one submission on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 45 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
