		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Suggested Books and Reference Material</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Logic in Computer Science (Michael Huth and Mark Ryan)
			<li> Model Checking (Edmund Clark, Orna Grumberg, Daniel Kroening, Doron Peled, and Helmut Veith)
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 30 marks. We will have 3
assignments of 10 marks each. The deadlines for the assignments will <u>not</u>
be extended, but every student will be allowed 5 days of penatly-free extension
(for all the assignments combined). Any further delay will cost you 0.5 marks
per hour.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 20 marks. There will be 5 surprize
quizzes in the class, of 5 marks each. There cannot be any make-up surprize
quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 4 out of the 5 quizzes.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 20 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 30 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
exam. If you miss the minor, your marks will be copied (after scaling
appropriately) from the major/re-major. A re-major exam will be held if
required, of course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: For an audit-pass, you must have at
least 40 marks (excluding the assignment marks), and attendance in at least 3
quizzes.</i> 
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others
copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in
such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your
participation/submission will not be counted.  Second-time offenders will be
summarily awarded an F grade.
		</ul>
