		To be decided!
		<!--Mondays and Thursdays, 02:00-03:20 pm--><!-- in IIA 305 (2nd floor, Bharti building)-->

		<h4 style="color:#813f2b;">
		Unfortunately, looking at the slot preferences I have received,
there is no single slot that seems to work for everyone. In order to reach a
decision, I suggest that we hold our introductory meeting on Monday, July 22nd,
at 13:30 hrs in LH 605. In this meeting, we will just discuss the course plan,
and I will leave you by 13:55 so that you can attend a 2 pm lecture if you are
interested.
	
		<br />

Please have an early lunch on 22nd and try to make it to this meeting. If you
are unable to join at 1:30 pm for whatever reason, please join as soon as you
can. I will wait for you in LH 605 till 2:30 pm. If you are simply not able to
join, please send me an email before this meeting (sharing your mobile no. if
possible) or ping me on Teams.

		<h3 style="color:blue;">Suggested Books and Reference Material</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Logic in Computer Science (Michael Huth and Mark Ryan)
			<li> Model Checking (Edmund Clark, Orna Grumberg, Daniel Kroening, Doron Peled, and Helmut Veith)
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Attendance</i>: 75 percent attendance is
mandatory. There may be a penalty for lack of attendance, which I will clarify
by July end.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 30 marks. We will have 3
assignments of 10 marks each. The deadlines for the assignments will <u>not</u>
be extended, but every student will be allowed 5 days of penatly-free extension
(for all the assignments combined). Any further delay will cost you 0.5 marks
per hour or part thereof.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 20 marks. There will be 5 surprize
quizzes in the class, of 5 marks each. There cannot be any make-up surprize
quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 4 out of the 5 quizzes.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 20 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 30 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
exam. If you miss the minor, your marks will be copied (after scaling
appropriately) from the major/re-major. A re-major exam will be held if
required, of course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: For an audit-pass, you must have at
least 40 marks in total (excluding the assignment marks), and attendance in at
least 3 quizzes.</i> 
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be <u>zero</u>
tolerance for dishonest means (including attendance proxy/fraud, copying or
sharing solutions in quizzes/exams/assignments, use of mobile phones or other
prohibited gadgets, etc.). Offenders will secure an F grade for themselves
straight away.
