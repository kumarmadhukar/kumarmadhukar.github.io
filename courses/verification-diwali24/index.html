		</p>

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Suggested Books and Reference Material</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Logic in Computer Science (Michael Huth and Mark Ryan)
			<li> Model Checking (Edmund Clark, Orna Grumberg, Daniel Kroening, Doron Peled, and Helmut Veith)
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 24 marks. We will have 3
assignments of 8 marks each. The deadlines for the assignments will <u>not</u>
be extended, but every student will be allowed 5 days of penatly-free extension
(for all the assignments combined). Any further delay will cost you half marks
per hour or part thereof.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 24 marks. There will be 5 surprize
quizzes in the class of 6 marks each, of which I will count the best 4. If your
attendance is more than 75 percent but still you have missed 2 or more quizzes,
I will let you write one additional make-up quiz (which won't be a surprize
quiz, of course).
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor/Mid-term exam</i>: 20 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Major/End-term exam</i>: 32 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
exam. If you miss the minor, your marks will be copied (after scaling
appropriately) from the major/re-major. A re-major exam will be held if
required, of course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: For an audit-pass, you must have at
least 45 marks in total (excluding the assignment marks). Plus, you must have
attended at least 2 surprize quizzes.</i> 
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be <u>zero</u>
tolerance for dishonest means (including attendance proxy/fraud, copying or
sharing solutions in quizzes/exams/assignments, use of mobile phones or other
prohibited gadgets, etc.). Offenders will secure an F grade for themselves
straight away.
		</ul>
