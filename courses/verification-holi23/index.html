		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: There will be 4 assignments in the course, of 10 marks each. Delayed submission will cost you two marks for every day of delay. Submitting an assignment after all the marks have been lost will <b>not</b> be allowed.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: There will be 7 surprize quizzes in the class (at any time during the class), of 5 marks each. There cannot be any make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will count the best 5.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor exam</i>: 10 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major exam</i>: 25 marks
				<br />
				<br />
		
			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor exam. If you miss the minor exam, we will scale your major exam marks. If you miss the major exam, we will have a re-major, as per the institute rules.

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: In order to pass, you must have attended at least 2 quizzes (one on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 2 assignments (one on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 30 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: You will be awarded an audit pass if you have attended at least 4 quizzes (with at least one quiz on either side of the minor exam), submitted at least 2 assignments (with at least one submission on either side of the minor exam), and obtained at least 45 marks in total.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
