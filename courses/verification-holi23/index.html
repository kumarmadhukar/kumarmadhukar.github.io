		<ul>
			<li style="color:red;">The reference material for all
				the lectures that have happened so far, except
				for the two lectures on Propositional SAT
				Solving, has been indicated in the Lectures
				section at the bottom of this page. The slides
				for the SAT lectures will be available soon.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Instead of the usual class on
				Monday, 20th March, we will have an online
				class (on Monday itself). The online class,
				however, will start at 01:00 pm and end at
				02:20 pm. The lecture will be recorded so that
				you can view it later at your convenience.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">We will have an online lecture
				on March 6th (at the class time, 1400-1520), to
				make-up for the lecture cancelled on Feb 13.
				This lecture will be recorded so that you can
				view it later at your convenience.

The due date is March 15th.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">We will have the first quiz
				either on 28th Jan, or on 30th Jan. If you are
				absent on the day of the first quiz, I will
				allow you to write a re-quiz on Friday, 3rd
				Feb, from 3:00-4:30 pm in my office. Please
				also note that the remaining quizzes will be
				surprize quizzes and you won't get an
				opportunity for a re-quiz in those.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">Please note the change in the
				classroom for our lectures. The classes will
				happen in IIA 305 (2nd floor, Bharti building).
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:orange;">If you have any
				doubts/questions/clarifications to discuss with
				me, please do so during the office hours (see
				above). If you would like to meet me outside

			<li> Logic in Computer Science (Michael Huth and Mark Ryan)
			<li> <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/papers/pdf/iisc2011-buchi.pdf" download>Finite-state Automata on Infinite Inputs</a> (Madhavan Mukund)

		Mondays and Thursdays, 02:00-03:20 pm in IIA 305 (2nd floor, Bharti building)
		<br />

		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4
				assignments of 6 marks each. The deadlines for
				the assignments will <u>not</u> be extended,
				but every student will be allowed 8 days of
				free extension (for all the assignments
				combined, which you may use anyhow). Additional
				delays will cost you 3 marks per day.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 20 marks. There will be 4 surprize
				quizzes in the class (at any time during the
				class), of 7 marks each. There cannot be any
				make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will
				count the total marks for quizzes as
				<i>min(20,s)</i> where <i>s</i> is the sum of
				all your quiz marks.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor I</i>: 14 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Minor II</i>: 14 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major</i>: 28 marks
				<br />
				<br />
		
			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
				exam for those crediting the course. If you
				miss a minor exam, your marks will be copied
				(after scaling appropriately) from the next
				exam in which you appear, in this order: Minor
				I &larr; Minor II &larr; Major. A re-major exam
				will be held if required, of course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

				<li><i>Audit</i>: At least <s>50%</s> 40%
					percent marks in every minor and major
					exam, and at least <s>14</s> 11 marks
						in all the quizzes combined.
						<i>Note, however, that if you
							are auditing, your
							marks won't be scaled
							and copied from the
							next exam if you miss
						one of the minors or the major
						exam. We will have re-exams for
					you.</i> 
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance
				for dishonest means like copying solutions from
				others, and even letting others copy your
				solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you
				are found indulging in such an activity, your
				answer paper will not be evaluated and your
				participation/submission will not be counted.
				Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded
				an F grade.
