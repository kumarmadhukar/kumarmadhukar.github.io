			<li style="color:red;">This page is under construction,
				and therefore any information given here, esp.
				the evaluation and assessment information, is
				subject to change till we meet on 5th Jan 2023
				for our first lecture.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">If you have any
				doubts/questions/clarifications to discuss, it
				can be done only during office hours (see
				above). If you would like to meet me outside
				the office hours, in-person or online, please
				send an email to set-up an appointment. You
				may, of course, catch me at the end of every
				lecture without a prior appointment.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">I understand that pinging on
				Teams may become necessary sometimes, and there
				may not be enough time to set an appointment or
				wait till the office hours. So, I will allow
				each one of you to do it on 5 occasions during
				the entire course, but after these five
				occasions, I am not obligated to reply on
				Teams. Sending an email is always an option, of
				course!
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">All announcements will be made
				here. Please do check this section of this page
				at least once every day.

		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4
				assignments of 6 marks each. The deadlines for
				the assignments will <u>not</u> be extended,
				but every student will be allowed 8 days of
				free extension (for all the assignments
				combined, which you may use anyhow). Additional
				delays will cost you 3 marks per day.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 20 marks. There will be 4 surprize
				quizzes in the class (at any time during the
				class), of 7 marks each. There cannot be any
				make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will
				count the total marks for quizzes as
				<i>min(20,s)</i> where <i>s</i> is the sum of
				all your quiz marks.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor I</i>: 14 marks
				<br />
				<br />
			
			<li><i>Minor II</i>: 14 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major</i>: 28 marks
				<br />
				<br />
		
			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
				exam. If you miss a minor exam, your marks will
				be copied (after scaling appropriately) from
				the next exam in which you appear, in this
				order: Minor I &larr; Minor II &larr; Major. A
				re-major exam will be held if required, of
				course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading
				scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: At least 50% percent marks in every
				minor and major exam, and at least 14 marks in
				all the quizzes combined.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
