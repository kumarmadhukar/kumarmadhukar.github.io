		<h3 style="color:blue;">Announcements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li style="color:red;">If you have any
				doubts/questions/clarifications to discuss, it
				can be done only during office hours (see
				above). If you would like to meet me outside
				the office hours, or if you wish to meet me
				online, please send an email to set-up an
				appointment. You may, of course, catch me at
				the end of every lecture without a prior
				appointment.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">I understand that pinging on
				Teams may become necessary sometimes, and there
				may not be enough time to set an appointment or
				wait till the office hours. So, I will allow
				each one of you to do it on 5 occasions during
				the entire course, but after these five
				occasions, I am not obligated to reply on
				Teams.
				<br />
				<br />
			<li style="color:red;">All announcements will be made
				here. Please do check this section of this page
				at least once every day.
		</ul>

		<h3 style="color:blue;">Evaluation and Assessment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Assignments</i>: 24 marks. We will have 4
				assignments of 6 marks each. The deadlines for
				the assignments will <u>not</u> be extended,
				but every student will be allowed 9 days of
				free extension (for all the assignments
				combined, which you may use anyhow). Additional
				delays will cost you 4 marks per day.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Quizzes</i>: 30 marks. There will be 7 surprize
				quizzes in the class (at any time during the
				class), of 6 marks each. There cannot be any
				make-up surprize quizzes, of course, but I will
				count the best 5.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Minor exam</i>: 16 marks
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Major exam</i>: 30 marks
				<br />
				<br />
		
			<li><i>Re-exams</i>: There will not be any re-minor
				exam. If you miss the minor exam, we will scale
				your major exam marks. A re-major exam will be
				held if required, of course.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Grading</i>: We will adopt a relative grading scheme.
				<br />
				<br />
				
			<li><i>Pass</i>: 30 marks or more, with at least 5
				marks in assignments, 5 in the quizzes, 5 in
				the minor exam, and 5 in the major exam.
				<br />
				<br />

			<li><i>Audit</i>: 45 marks or more, with an attendance
				in at least 4 quizzes. Plus, the passing
				criteria (see above).
				<br />
				<br />

			<li style="color:red;"> There will be zero tolerance for dishonest means like copying solutions from others, and even letting others copy your solution, in any quiz/exam/assignment. If you are found indulging in such an activity, your answer paper will not be evaluated and your participation/submission will not be counted. Second-time offenders will be summarily awarded an F grade.
